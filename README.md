# Database systems (Sistemi baza podataka)

## Build for univeristy project, graded 300 out of 300.

Project consisted of three stages.

### First stage
In the first stage of the project we were required to design EER diagram, which involved defining entities, releationships, attributes, ... We had to make use of advanced EER concepts such as unions, categories and other features that extend the basic ER diagram. After completing the EER diagram, we used SQL to create the corresponding tables in database and populate them with data.

### Second stage
In the second stage of the project, we were tasked with implementing databse triggers specifically for auto-indexing. These triggers would automatically create indexes in the database whenever operation like insert occured.
In addition to creating triggers we were tasked with creating Fluent NHibernate mappings. This involved configuring ORM, where we linked our database tables with our domain models to reduce the need for manual SQL queries. To show that all of our mappings worked we had to create WinForms app to showcase all of the funcionalities of our application such as CRUD operations and displaying data from the database.

### Third stage
The main focuse of the third stage was on refining and extending the work from the second stage. Instead of the WinForms app, we had to develop Web API. The API had the same functionalities that were previously handled by WinForms app, but now in web-based format. We also used Swagger to demonstrate the API's endpoints, allowing us to showcase all of the functionalities.
